## My Leadership Philosophy

I believe people deliver their best work when empowered with the **freedom**
and **authority** to get the job done. I've learned that most people aren't even
fully aware of their own potential, because the company structures around them
stifle potential output. I consequently look to maximize the area that my team
has to move around by minimizing restrictions placed on them.

Some of the greatest ideas follow the comment, "We've never done things like
that around here..."

## My answers to [first 1:1 questions](http://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/ "What to ask in the first 1:1")


#### What makes you grumpy?

Identifying the solution to a problem and not being permitted to go
fix it (assume it's a worthwhile endeavor, and/or I don't have something
better to do with my time). These sorts of problems are usually a symptom of
crusty, outdated policy: what started out as a useful guideline to avoid a known
pitfall has become an obstruction over time.

Conversely, fixing these issues makes me feel like I'm contributing, moving the
team/product/company forward.

#### How will I know when you’re grumpy?

I'll usually say so. My wife tells me I wear it on my sleeve.

#### How can I help you when you’re grumpy?

Tell me you see it, ask what's up, and then just help me talk through it. By
that time, the problem has been rolling around in my head, building up. I tend
to assume the worst, and presenting the issue to another person usually brings
me back to equilibrium.

#### How do you like feedback - slack, email, in person, etc?

In person, video chat, phone, in that order. Human interaction loses so much
nuance over email and chat, which is extremely important when providing
constructive criticism.

#### How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens?

As it happens. The closer to the problem, the better I can scope the problem to
its source.

#### How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)

Private is generally sufficient, but recognition of suitable "weight" should be
public. Occasionally letting everyone when you've accomplished something allows
the team to celebrate with you, spreading the good vibes around.

I have the same mentality when handing out recognition to my team.

#### What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?

Building the relationship, which in turn improves communication effectiveness.

#### What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?

I've joined a team of true experts in the field, and I feel like I have a lot
to learn! I need to bulk up on relevant technicals, to ensure I am representing
the company to the best of my ability, and increasing our overall velocity. If
you're not growing, you're dying!

Ditto the next 3 months, plus refreshing my consulting chops. Been a corporate
guy for too long!

#### What do you need from your manager?

Open communication and honesty at all times. If you are dealing with a problem
and I can be of help, let me know. If I'm the problem, let me know. If I'm not
the problem but I can have an impact on it, let me know. I should never be
surprised about where I stand with you, my team or my company.

[Stole this verbatim from [Gary Foster](https://github.com/gfoster/README/blob/master/README.md),
because I couldn't see a way to improve upon it.]

#### From your team?

Zero hesitation come to me with a problem or question. I can't help you be
awesome if I don't know when something's up.

Also an equal lack of hesitation to support your teammates. Offer to help,
poke them when you think there's a problem, and share your war-torn wisdom.

#### From your peers? (outside the team)

Willingness to share your knowledge and experience. Our team has a very diverse
background, and none of us knows it all. Sharing your wisdom makes the
individual and the company better for it.

#### What’s your favourite baked good?

Donuts. Preferably with sprinkles, filled with creme, covered in icing, or any
other crazy, deliciously awful concoction.


## My expectations of folks who report to me

- **Be honest, in all ways** - If we cannot trust each other, we have nothing.
Everything below is an extension of trust.
- **Own your work** - I take a very hands-off approach to managing your daily
output -- you're a competent professional, and don't need a babysitter -- but
with great power comes great responsibility.
- **Look for improvements** - Even if you don't execute on them, identifying
areas that we are coming up short and then offering ways to make it better is
literally the _only_ way any company improves. This includes feedback on my
management ability.
- **Be quick to say "I don't know."** - Admitting ignorance on a subject earns a
lot of points in my book. We never stop learning, and no one can know it all.
Talking through an area of weakness gives us all a chance to grow and improve.
- **Tell me when/how I can do better** - I am *far* from perfect, and rely on
your feedback to improve. Perhaps contrary to usual instincts, I freely give
away brownie points whenever anyone finds me lacking, and then finds the guts to
tell me about it.


## What you can expect of me as your manager

**TL;DR** - My goal is to support you to the fullest extent you desire and
require, then get the hell out of your way.

It's pithy, but there's a fair bit at play in there. I'm always available
any time you have a problem or question. Never hesitate to come talk to me, we
will work through it. I'll grant you the same courtesy in return if I see a
problem: you'll know immediately, and have my unwavering support in fixing it.

When you're cruising along, my interference is only going to hinder your ability
to deliver awesome results. You're a competent, capable human, and don't need
anyone watching over your shoulder. I'd much rather sit on the sidelines, cheer
you on, and celebrate your victories.
